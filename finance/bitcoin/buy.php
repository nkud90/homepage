    <h1>Buying Bitcoins</h1>
    <p>I consider buying bitcoins at an <b>online exchange</b> to be quite safe, cost-effective and convenient way to do so.</p>
    <p>As exchanges come and go, it is practical to find the <b>most popular</b> ones in your country in terms of <b>trading volume</b>.</p>
    <p><b>P2P (peer to peer)</b> exchanges is a good option in case of country-specific <b>issues with money deposits</b> to centralized exchanges.</p>
    <p>
        It is a good practice to buy bitcoins without <b>KYC</b> procedure for not to leave your identity information in a database which are prone to be hacked. 
        But as it is usually not very convenient in terms of muted trading volumes and underdeveloped exchanges, <b>it is not a must</b>: 
        if bitcoins are stored securely, there is nothing critical in leaking the information that you own them.
