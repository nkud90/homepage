    <h1>Why Bitcoin?</h1>
    <p>
        I believe that it is efficient for humanity to cooperate on one single apolitical monetary system (as well as language, and many other things).
        My view is that Bitcoin is currently the best option for this purpose for several reasons:
    </p>
    
    <h2>‚è≥ Established history</h2>
    <p>It has the largest history of all the competing cryptocurrencies, being the first one, tested for as many bugs and errors as possible.</p>
    
    <h2>üåê True decentralization</h2>
    <p>
        Bitcoin blockchain, which is a registry of all the transactions ever been made, 
        is <a href="https://bitnodes.io" class="external" target="_blank">truly decentralized</a>, 
        being relatively democratic in terms of the amount of computer memory it takes up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For a ledger to be sufficiently decentralized it should be stored on a large number of computers - full nodes. 
        The full nodes store the entire blockchain (in some networks the "full node" is just a name, and in fact they do not store the whole transactions database).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the number of full nodes to be effectively large it should be economically possible to store the data on an average person's computer. 
        With Bitcoin's relatively small block size it is designed to be possible in the first place.
    </p>

    <h2>üîê Immense security</h2>
    <p>
        A blockchain's security is a product of the cost of the attack on it.
        I consider Bitcoin blockchain to be the most secure as it is the most expensive blockchain to attack in terms of the amount of electricity required to do so. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some projects which moved away from the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, which entrenches the security of a blockchain into the physical world.
        It seems that getting a group of large stakeholders together to influence a blockchain is much easier than to gather a group of industrial miners from different jurisdictions.
    </p> 

    <h2>üïµÔ∏è Resistance to influence</h2>
    <p>
        As a network, Bitcoin is truly apolitical as there is no group of individuals with critical decision making power over it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bitcoin is considered to be a commodity rather than a security by world's leading national authorities. 
        It is the presence of a central beneficiary that makes the difference between these two terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The absence of any organization behind the Bitcoin is a critical fact that makes it suitable even for countries from different political camps.
