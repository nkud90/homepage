    <h1>How to preserve wealth</h1>
    <h2>To divide capital</h2>
    <p>
        Since it seems impossible to achieve absolute security, one's assets should be divided into several parts,
        making a loss of one of them not critical.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several tips regarding this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>It is practical to have from 2 to 6 parts, as more can potentially be hard to manage;</li>
        <li>The parts should be principally independent parts or places or assets.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="example">
        <h3>💡 Example</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Poor</b>: three equity ETFs of the same country from one ETF provider on one brokerage account. <br>
            A single event - broker's or ETF provider's insolvancy, country-specific event - can lead to a loss of all the whole capital.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Good</b>: (1) ETF on a brokerage account, (2) real estate and (3) bitcoins on cold storage. <br>
            Almost no single event can lead to a loss of all the capital.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The key idea behind this is to have some capital for a fresh start in the event of an emergency leading to the total loss of one of the parts: a fundamentally unavoidable risk.
    </p>
    <h2>To invest in high-quality assets</h2>
    <p>
        The quality of an asset is determined by it's history (the test of time), scale of adoption, accountability, transparency, liquidity, transferrability.
    </p>
